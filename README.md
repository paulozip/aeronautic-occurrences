# Aeronautic occurrences in Brazil
In this presentation I will be using open datas that were available by CENIPA - Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes aeronáuticos - or Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center. You may have access to newer data by visiting the <a href='http://dados.gov.br/dataset/ocorrencias-aeronauticas-da-aviacao-civil-brasileira'>Brazilian Open Data's official website</a>, or just clicking in the following links in order to download the datasets:

Occurrences.csv: it contains the data of each occurrence recorded in the last 10 years. Occurrence ID, Date, Occurrence cause and Location are found in this dataset.

Airships.csv: CSV file containing information about airships envolved in registered occurrence. Here you will find the following type of data: Airship Model, Airship Type, Manufacturer, Fatalities, and so on.
