# Aeronautic occurrences in Brazil
In this presentation I will be using open datas that were available by CENIPA - Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes aeronáuticos - or Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center. You may have access to newer data by visiting the <a href='http://dados.gov.br/dataset/ocorrencias-aeronauticas-da-aviacao-civil-brasileira'>Brazilian Open Data's official website</a>, or just clicking in the following links in order to download the datasets:

Occurrences.csv: it contains the data of each occurrence recorded in the last 10 years. Occurrence ID, Date, Occurrence cause and Location are found in this dataset.

Aircraft.csv: CSV file containing information about aircrafts envolved in registered occurrence. Here you will find the following type of data: Aircraft Model, Aircraft Type, Manufacturer, Fatalities, and so on.

# Questions to answer
<li>What are the major occurrence causes and, eventually, airplane falling?</li>
<li>How it has progressed in the last years? Was there fewer or more occurrences?</li>
<li>Which states did register more occurrences?</li>
<li>What kind of aircraft has shown more problems? Airplanes, jets, gliders?</li>
<li>What are the manufacturers that has shown more faults?</li>
<li>Is more likely the aircraft fail during the takeoff or during the landing? Is the cruise phase a risk moment?</li>
<li>Do regular trips have more occurrences than chartered flights?</li>
<li>How many fatalities have we registered in the last 10 years?</li>
